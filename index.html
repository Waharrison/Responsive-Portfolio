            <p id="main-content">
                William Harrison born March 11, 1985 in Greensboro, NC. Now lets skip ahead after High school William
                graduated from UNC-Greensboro in 2007 with a bachelor degree in Small Business. Taking his new small
                business degree he went to work for his family business at Graham Sporting Goods in Burlington, NC. </p>
            <p> 5 years later he moved back to Greensboro and started the website GrahamSG.com. Where he sells hats,
                socks, shirts and other sporting goods apparel online. The site has been gradually growing over the
                last few years and is becoming one of the larger dealers of custom hats in the southeast. Looking to
                expand his website and brand William is taking a coding course hoping on taking is website to the next
                level.
            </p>
            <p>What does William enjoy doing in his free time?</p>
            <p> William has a wife named Katelin, a 3 year old daughter named Lilly and a Karelian Bear Dog named
                Bella. I suggest googling about Karelian Bear Dogs. They are rare and unique breed of dogs. William
                spends his limited free time hanging out with his family and hiking in the mountains. </p>
